# Amazon-Best-Seller

I wanted to practice web scraping and inspecting DOM elements in a webpage. So I created this JSOUP project in which I scratch the Amazon Best selling book website and display it using Server Logic with Servlet.

I created a dynamic web page listing the top 100 best-selling books from Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/). The program consists of 3 components:
 A JavaScript/CSS program that creates user interactions and responsive layout.
 A web scraper that extracts book data from Amazon and stores it in a Java DB.
 A servlet program that produces the HTML book listing by loading data from the DB.

I have to still work on the UI and JS component to create user interactions. The backend logic is complete. An HTML page is displayed till now with the books’ cover image, ranking, title, author and price. Future plan is to add interaction and scrap deeper.

I was also thinking to add in-page filtering/searching later to the project using JS.
